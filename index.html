        <div id="title"><h1>Popular blogger "Ashley" fakes kidnapping and is revealed to be a fraud.</h1><h2>February 8, 2022 Posted: 5:20 p.m. EDT (2120 GMT)</h2><p id="firstP">A lifestyle blogger who goes by the name "Ashley" has attracted a large amount of social media attention over the past week due to the suspicion of her kidnapping. On her popular blog titled "<a href="https://maryhatcher.github.io/AshleyzBlog/">AshleyzBlog</a>," Ashley claims to be an "actress, model, singer, athlete, and an entrepreneur." After making multiple strange posts on her blog, fans began to theorize that she had been kidnapped. <br><br>While the internet erupted in hysteria, Ashley did not post a single thing. Some started to theorize that one of Ashley's fans, who goes by the name of "<a href="https://twitter.com/a5HL3ySUP3rF4N">a5HL3ySUP3rF4N</a>," was behind the kidnapping due to posting strange videos and being referenced multiple times on Ashley's blog. While her fans panicked, our journalists at YOUR NEWS TODAY took matters into their own hands and found Ashley themselves. <br><br>We managed to track Ashley down to a suburb in West Virginia, far from the California neighborhood of "Calabasas" which she claims to frequent. When Ashley opened the door, she looked nothing like the Ashley from "AshleyzBlog" in fact, her name isn't even Ashley! We met 20 year old Brooke Johnson who not only pretended to be Ashley but also her superfan/suspected kidnapper.<br><br>When we asked her: "Why did you do it?" Brooke responded:<br><br>"I just got sick and tired of pretending to be someone that I wasn't. I had fun pretending to be the cool, rich model on the internet. I pretended to be my crazy superfan just for fun. I didn't expect to get any kind of attention. Once my blog got more popular, it started to stress me out. I got so scared people would find out that I was a fake, so I decided to make Ashley mysteriously disappear. All those hidden messages were so people would assume that I must be gone forever or something. I didn't think there would be a big fuss about it. I'm sorry."<br><br>Pictured below: Brooke Johnson, the true identity of "Ashley" (left) & "a5HL3ySUP3rF4N," Brooke's other secret identity (right).</p>
